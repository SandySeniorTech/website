               I am a married (41 years) mother of two adult children.  
               This qualifies anyone for the Senior Center Advisory Council.  
               I have a degree in Medical Technology from the University of Utah.  
               I am also a Specialist in Blood Bank Technology.   
               I was a supervisor of Blood Bank Hematology, Specimen Receiving,
               and Phlebotomy, Evening and Night Shift overseeing 
               17 full time and 10 part time employees.  
            </p>
            <p>
               I enjoy classes at the senior center: Enhanced Fitness, 
               Fit and Trim, Yoga, and Tai Chi.

               They are running as a team because Gary can’t hear well and 
               Donna can’t see; together they can do <b>ANYTHING</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
               Donna and Gary met in high school in 1952.  After graduation, 
               Gary joined the Marine Core.  Following that he went to 
               work for the US Postal Service, where he was a carrier 
               for 35 years.  Then he became an accident investigator.  
               Gary retired in 1991, and they moved to their 1865 cabin 
               in San Bernardino Mountains.  He then did some major 
               renovations to the cabin, including a 1000 sq ft addition.  
               It nearly burned down in 2003 while they were visiting their 
               children in Salt Lake.
            </p>
            <p>
               As a young person Donna was active and president of PTA, Girl Scouts, 
               Brownies, and a Cub Scout Leader.  She worked with handicapped 
               kids and loved it.  She also owned a craft business, and 
               loved to create, in hopes of making people smile. 
               As a young person Gary was active with Boy Scouts, encouraging work ethics.  
               Both of their sons are Eagle Scouts.  He was also active in Toastmasters.  
            </p>
            <p>   
               They are proud to be members of the Sandy Senior Center; they never knew 
               there was a place so welcoming and filled with nice people that just make 
               you feel good with a smile.  They would like to be on the Senior Center 
               Advisory board to represent all their friends with different abilities and interests.

               I feel I have skills that can contribute to maintaining the high 
               standards of our Sandy Senior Center Advisory Council.  
               I value what the center has to offer.  As a member I have 
               benefited from the friendships and programs that the center provides. 
            </p>
            <p>
               I have fifty two years of experience working with a variety of people.  
               Over time I have developed strong organizational skills and possess 
               the ability to listen to peoples’ needs and concerns.  I would like 
               to contribute to keeping our Sandy Senior Center a place where 
               everyone can feel welcomed.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

               My name is Joe Bycroft, I am married to Joni Greenwell Bycroft. 
               We have one son Joey. I am retired after 37 years with the Rio 
               Grande/Union Pacific Rail Road. I worked in the communications 
               Dept. I grew up in Phoenix AZ, and first came to Utah in 1977 
               when I moved to Bullfrog Resort at Lake Powell. After a 3 year 
               stint, I moved to Colorado to work on the Rail Road, after many 
               transfers landed here in Salt Lake City in 1993, when I made 
               Utah my home. I have one hobby -- golf, and of course follow 
               the U of U Football and Basketball teams.

               I want to be on the committee in order to make sure that

               different classes to keep us engaged and active.

               Hello, I'm Joni Greenwell Bycroft.
            </p>
            <p>
               I joined the Sandy Senior Center in 2016 as I prepared 
               for retirement from my 30 year career as a Director for 
               the Federal Child Care Food Program. I would love to 
               serve on this committee to help keep our Center funded 
               and vital with relevant classes and activities that 
               enhance our lives as well as our community.
            </p>
            <p>
               In addition to enjoying the fun and interesting discussion 
               groups and classes here at the Center, I have been active 
               in politics as a Precinct Captain for my political party, 
               the historian for the Women's Democratic Club, an advisor 
               with the Democratic Finance committee; Secretary and Historian 
               for the Utah Health Care Caucus; and a thankful member 
               and observer of the Utah League of Women Voters.
            </p>
            <p>
               My life is full and fun. I LOVE retirement, and I'm looking 
               forward to many years enjoying my favorite pastimes of reading; 
               traveling to eat yummy food; visiting and learning from 
               interesting people and friends; and bossing around my 
               wonderful husband Joe
