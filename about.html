               enlighten, educate and enrich the lives of mature adults who want a broad
               spectrum of life experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
               Programs include classes, lectures, forums,

            <h3>
               Standard of Conduct
            </h3>
            <p>
               All members throughout Salt Lake County Senior Centers are asked to
               follow a Standard of Conduct to ensure a safe, healthy and pleasant
               environment for everyone. A copy is available at the reception desk.

            <h3>Checking in with Your Membership Card</h3>
            <p>
               Every time you use the facility, you are asked to scan your card at the
               reception desk. Scanning is important &mdash; this is how we track
               participation and receive funding for programs and activities. We
               report the number of	participants monthly to Salt Lake County.

               NOTE: You can always present your Sandy Senior Center card if you
               go to another County Center to avoid being required to fill out another
               Data	Intake form. Your assigned membership number is the same for all
               County Centers and other Aging Services Programs.

               Sandy City Transportation
            </h3>
            <p>
               For those adults age 60 and up, living in Sandy City or White City who
               do not have access to an automobile, the Sandy Parks and Recreation
               Department provides transportation Monday through Friday.
            </p>
            <p>
               Pick-up begins at 7:30 a.m. from your residence.
            </p>
            <p>
               You will be leaving the Center at 1:00 p.m. for your return trip home.
            </p>
            <p>
               For more information, call Scott directly 801-230-5673.
            </p>
            <img src="images/Transportation.JPG" alt="Sandy City Transportation" class="img-responsive img-rounded imageShadow center-block" />
            <br />
            <p>
               There are some areas in the City that are inaccessible to the bus due
               to narrow lanes or difficult driveways. Each request for transportation
               is evaluated and the decision is based on accessibility and safety
               conditions. A call to Scott will clarify any transportation issues. All
               van participants are required to wear seat belts. Whenever road
               conditions are unsafe, the morning pickup time will be delayed or
               canceled. The driver will call those on the transportation pickup list
               to advise them of the changes. If a major storm drops 7” to 12” of
               snow, transportation will be canceled and, in most cases, the Center
               will be closed as well. It is the responsibility of the transportation
               driver and Center staff to keep seniors as safe as possible.

            <p>
               A lost and found area is located at the reception desk.
               If you find items, please turn them in to a receptionist.
               Items left unclaimed after several months will be displayed
               for a week. Unclaimed items will be sold in the Trinkets and

            <h3>Building Rental Policy</h3>
            <p>
               The Sandy Center was built in 1997 using Housing and Urban
               Development funding. HUD regulations prohibit the Center from
               being rented out for public use. However, the City and/or Center
               Staff may consider any activities that are sponsored by the seniors
               and have at least 80 percent attendance over the age of 60. These
               special activities are held during the afternoon and on Thursday
               evenings during <a href="/contact.html">normal open hours.</a>

               In order to help protect your identity and keep documents with
               personal information from falling into the wrong hands, the Center
               provides access to a professional, secure document shredding service.

            <p>
               At the entrance to the Center is a large locked shredder container.
               Any documents placed in the shredder container will be securely destroyed.

            <h3>Building Care</h3>
            <p>
               We are very proud of our beautiful building.
               One of the most difficult tasks for our janitorial staff is
               dealing with spills on the carpets and furniture.
            </p>
            <p>
               Therefore, we ask that you put lids on drinks when moving around
               the Center. If a spill does occur, please notify the staff immediately
               so that cleaning can be accomplished as quickly as possible.
            </p>

         <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h3>Use of Center Equipment</h3>
            <p>
               There are many expensive and hard-to-replace pieces of equipment
               located throughout the building. These include the commercial exercise
               machines, quilting frames, computers, billiard tables, scanners,
               decorations, sound system, televisions, VCR’s, Wii equipment, pottery
               wheels, ping pong tables, stained glass equipment, whiteboards, paintings,
               tables, chairs, etc. We encourage members to treat these items the same
               as you would in your own home. If you notice someone is abusing his or
               her privileges, please notify a staff member.

            <h3>Copy Machine Usage</h3>
            <p>
               The copy machine is available to all instructors for classroom
               materials. If individuals wish to copy any other materials, there
               is a 10-cent cost for an 8.5 x 11 sheet or 20 cents for an 11 x 17
               sheet. Salt Lake County Aging Service Centers Program purchases all the
               paper used at the Center. This money is returned to Salt Lake County.
               Please request a staff member to make copies for you.

            <h3>Information/Program Tables</h3>
            <p>
               There are many things to do each day at the Center. In order to
               provide the best service possible, the staff provides a description of
               activities and a registration sheet for most activities. The sheets are
               located across from the meal aide desk on the way into Centre Café.
               To participate in an activity, it is helpful if you write your name and
               phone number down on the sheet so that the instructor/leader knows how
               many individuals to plan for. The leader or a receptionist can call to
               remind you as well. As you browse the Information/Program Corner, also
               note the pictures on the bulletin board that describe other programs at
               the Center.

            <h3>Lock Down/Lock Out</h3>
            <p>
               The purpose of the lock down/lock out plan is to provide protection to
               employees and/or patrons at the Center if a situation arises involving
               an active shooter, dangerous intruder(s), or any other incident(s) that
               may result in harm to persons inside or outside the building.
            </p>
            <p>
               When it’s time to lock down:
            </p>
            <ol>
               <li>Recognize the situation and notify 911 or</li>
               <li>
                  Quickly notify all participants of the emergency (over a public
                  address system if possible): “THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. THIS BUILDING
                  IS NOW IN LOCKDOWN. QUICKLY PROCEED TO A SAFE AREA. LOCK AND SECURE
                  ALL EXTERIOR DOORS. SOME SAFE AREAS ARE: OUTREACH OFFICE RM. 106, UTILITY
                  ROOM OFF THE CAFÉ, OR RM. 206 THRIFT SALES ROOM, 201 EXERCISE ROOM.”
               </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
               Emergency situations are inherently chaotic; the best protection in such
               a situation is preparation. Staff will periodically review their options and
               plans and at least twice per year hold drills to rehearse emergency procedures.
               For such drills, emergency scenarios will vary from time to time in order to
               provide various possible response options in the event of an actual emergency.
